Dowload and open the zip file for this project. In this folder there is:
- A templates folder including all the HTML pages
- app.py, the Python file to actually be run
- harv.db, the database file that includes the users and websites databases.
- Harvard Websites.csv, a list of websites I created to add to my database using SQL.
- requirements.txt, a list of libraries that must be downloaded for this project to work. This is important for the project to run.
- sources.txt, a list of sources I used in creating this project (not relevant for implementation purposes)

If you don't have VS Code or a similar program installed on your computer, install this first. Make sure you have run pip install (or pip3 install, based on your computer) for all of the libraries listed in requirements.txt. At this point, Flask should be working on your computer. You should navigate to this folder in your terminal and run the command "flask run". This should run the server, and you can go to the link displayed, which should run the project.
